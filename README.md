This Project is for educational purpose. I had gived ChatGPT 4 my resume and I had given the prompt to create a Vue website based on my resume. 
After lots of prompts, I can safely say that ChatGPT won't replace developers anytime soon.
You can check the first website that it built for me and the second version. I trained it for more than 2h with different prompts.
I also fetched it with different source codes so it could learn for the examples. However the results are not the best.

If you would like to run the project:


**Step 1**


`npm install`


**Step 2**

`npm run serve`
